A professional GitHub profile README can be a powerful way to introduce yourself, highlight your key projects, and even link dynamic content like your blog posts.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Build a visually engaging README using Markdown
- Highlight your most relevant projects
- Automatically update your blog posts in the README
- Connect your personal blog built with **Next.js** to your GitHub profile

---

## 🧠 Why have a professional README?

A profile README is the first thing visitors see on your GitHub. It acts like your **developer portfolio**, so it should reflect:

- Who you are
- What you're building
- Where to find your work (projects, blog, LinkedIn, etc.)

Here's what we'll build:

## 🚀 Step 1: Create the `README.md`

In a repository named exactly as your GitHub username (e.g. `dennerrondinely`), create a `README.md` and structure it with:

```md
# 👋 Hello, I'm Denner

- [Blog](https://www.dennerrondinely.dev/en)
```

## ⚙️ Step 2: Expose your blog posts with an API

If you use `Markdown` files locally in a `Next.js` blog, expose your posts through a route like:

```
/pages/api/posts.ts
```

This should return the latest 5 posts in JSON.

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Write the update script

Create a file like `scripts/update-blog-posts.ts`:

```ts
// fetches latest blog posts and updates the README
```

---

## 🤖 Step 4: Automate with GitHub Actions

Create the file:

```
.github/workflows/update-blog-posts.yml
```

With the following:

```yaml
name: Update blog posts in README
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  update-readme: ...
```

---

## 🧩 Bonus: Add your favorite technology badges

Use [shields.io](https://shields.io/) to generate badges like:

```md
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
```

---

## ✅ Result

You'll have a GitHub profile that:

- Shows what you're working on
- Updates automatically
- Promotes your personal blog
