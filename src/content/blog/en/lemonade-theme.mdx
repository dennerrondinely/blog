# üçã Building and Publishing the Lemonade VS Code Theme

Creating your own Visual Studio Code theme is a rewarding way to personalize your coding experience and share your style with the world. In this article, I'll walk you through how I created the Lemonade theme, how you can build your own, publish it to the VS Code Marketplace, and automate the process with GitHub Actions.

## Why Lemonade?

I wanted a modern, vibrant, and readable dark theme inspired by Atom Material, but with a unique color palette and special highlights for tags, quotes, and more. Thus, Lemonade was born!

## 1. How to Create a VS Code Theme

1. **Set up your project:**

   - Create a new folder and initialize with `npm init`.
   - Add a `package.json` with the required fields (`name`, `displayName`, `description`, `version`, `publisher`, `engines`, `categories`, `contributes`).
   - Create a `themes/` folder and add your color theme JSON (e.g., `lemonade-color-theme.json`).

2. **Define your color palette:**

   - Choose a base color (Lemonade uses `#2A2D34`).
   - Add accent colors for tags, keywords, strings, etc.
   - Map VS Code UI and syntax tokens to your palette.

3. **Test locally:**
   - Open the folder in VS Code.
   - Press `F5` to launch an Extension Development Host and preview your theme.

## 2. How to Publish Your Theme

1. **Create a publisher:**

   - Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).
   - Create a publisher and get your Personal Access Token (PAT).

2. **Install vsce:**

   ```sh
   npm install -g @vscode/vsce
   ```

3. **Package your theme:**

   ```sh
   vsce package
   ```

   This generates a `.vsix` file.

4. **Publish:**
   ```sh
   vsce publish -p <YOUR_PAT>
   ```

## 3. Automate Publishing with GitHub Actions

You can automate publishing on every push to `main` with a workflow like this:

```yaml
name: Publish VS Code Extension
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx vsce publish -p ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
        env:
          VSCE_PAT: ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
```

Add your VSCE_PAT as a secret in your GitHub repository.

## 4. Lessons Learned

- Always test your theme with different languages and file types.
- Use a `.vscodeignore` to keep your extension package clean.
- Add a LICENSE and a good README.

## 5. Try Lemonade!

You can find the Lemonade theme on [GitHub](https://github.com/dennerrondinely/lemonade) and in the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Denner.lemonade-theme).
