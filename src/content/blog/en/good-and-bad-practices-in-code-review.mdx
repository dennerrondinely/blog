# **Good and Bad Practices in Code Review: How to Be a Better Reviewer**

## Why Good Code Review Matters

Code review is one of the most important steps in the software development process. It goes far beyond finding bugs — it’s a moment of mutual learning, technical alignment, and continuous quality improvement. 

However, not all code reviews are productive — some can create frustration, demotivate developers, or even generate team conflicts.

Here’s a critical breakdown of what separates a *good* code review from a *bad* one, along with practical tips to apply in your day-to-day work.

## ❌ Bad Code Review Practices

Avoid these behaviors to foster a healthier and more productive environment:

### 1. **Blaming the developer and focusing only on problems**

Comments that attack the author of the code create defensiveness. Focus on the code, not the person.

### 2. **Using a toxic or aggressive tone**

Sarcasm, irony, or rude language have no place in a professional and mature team. Respect is the foundation of constructive feedback.

### 3. **Reviewing only the lines that changed**

A good reviewer considers how changes affect the broader context of the system, not just the specific diff.

### 4. **Giving vague or generic feedback**

Saying “this is bad” without explanation or alternatives is frustrating and unhelpful.

### 5. **Requesting low-priority changes in urgent tickets**

Pointless style suggestions or nitpicks during tight deadlines add no real value and delay the team.

### 6. **Imposing personal preferences**

If something follows team standards, there’s no reason to force a personal taste.

## ✅ Good Code Review Practices

These behaviors make the process more effective, fair, and collaborative:

### 1. **Highlighting what was done well**

A good reviewer also recognizes clean, well-structured solutions. Positive feedback motivates and teaches.

### 2. **Being collaborative and respectful**

Always use a constructive tone. Instead of “this is wrong,” try “a better approach might be…”

### 3. **Evaluating the broader impact**

Look beyond the commit to see if the change affects performance, other modules, or business logic.

### 4. **Explaining the reasoning behi**
