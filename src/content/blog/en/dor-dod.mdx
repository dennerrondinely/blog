# ✅ Understanding Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) in Agile Teams

If you’ve ever worked in an agile environment, you’ve probably heard about **Definition of Ready (DoR)** and **Definition of Done (DoD)**.  
These two concepts are simple in theory but extremely powerful in practice. They create alignment, avoid misunderstandings, and set a clear standard for quality and delivery.

In this article, I’ll explain both concepts in a **didactic way**, with examples you can apply directly to your team.

## 🔎 What is Definition of Ready (DoR)?

The **Definition of Ready** is the set of criteria that a user story or task must meet **before** the development team can start working on it.  
It ensures that the team has all the information needed and that the backlog item is clear, feasible, and well-prioritized.

Without a DoR, teams often face **ambiguities, delays, and rework**.

### Example DoR for a Development Squad

- The user story has a clear and concise description
- Business rules and acceptance criteria are defined
- Dependencies are mapped and manageable
- The story has been estimated by the team
- The item is prioritized in the backlog

👉 If a story doesn’t meet these points, it’s simply **not ready** to enter a sprint.

## 🏁 What is Definition of Done (DoD)?

While the DoR defines when something is ready to start, the **Definition of Done** defines when something is truly **finished**.  
It is a **quality agreement** between the team, Product Owner, and stakeholders.

The DoD avoids situations like:

> "The feature is coded, but tests are missing."  
> "It works locally, but we haven’t deployed it yet."

### Example DoD for a Development Squad

- Code implemented and reviewed (pull request approved)
- Unit tests created and passing
- Integration tests executed successfully
- Code deployed in the test/staging environment
- Acceptance criteria validated by QA and/or Product Owner
- Documentation updated if necessary

👉 With a DoD, there’s no room for "almost done."  
The feature is either **done** or it’s **not done**.

## ⚖️ DoR vs DoD

| Concept | When Applied              | Purpose                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DoR** | Before development starts | Ensures the story is clear, feasible, and ready for the team    |
| **DoD** | After development ends    | Ensures the story meets quality standards and is truly finished |

Together, they create a **development lifecycle guardrail**:

- **DoR** = clarity before starting
- **DoD** = quality before finishing

---

## 🚀 Benefits of Using DoR and DoD

- **Fewer misunderstandings** between PO, devs, and stakeholders
- **Higher quality deliveries** with less rework
- **Predictable sprint outcomes**
- **Clearer team alignment** on expectations
- **Improved communication** inside the squad

---

## 📝 Conclusion

Both **Definition of Ready** and **Definition of Done** are essential to healthy agile practices.  
They bring structure without bureaucracy and help teams **deliver value consistently**.

If your team doesn’t have them formalized yet, start small:

- Define 3–5 **DoR** criteria for backlog items
- Define 3–5 **DoD** criteria for delivery quality

Over time, refine them based on your team’s needs.  
The goal is not to create rigid rules but to build a **shared agreement** that guides the team towards success.
